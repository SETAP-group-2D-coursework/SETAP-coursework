Implementation
==============

**Elements of Implementation**
   **Technologies Used**: The project was developed using a combination of technologies to ensure a robust and scalable application.
      - *Frontend:* HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript were used to build the user interface. The design focuses on simplicity and accessibility for tasks like room creation and joining.
      
      - *Backend:* Node.js with Express.js was used to handle server-side logic, including routing, session handling, and API requests.
      
      - *Database:* PostgreSQL was used as the relational database system, managed through the pg Node.js library. It stores user data, room information, participants, and notifications.

      - *Authentication:* Session-based authentication was implemented using express-session to manage user login states securely across requests.

      - *Notifications(Planned):* Internal notification logic is implemented, with room to extend to email or push notifications in future iterations.
