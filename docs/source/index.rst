Scope of the Project

Slot-ify is a web - based group scheduling and collaboration application developed to help students coordinate team meetings and manage shared tasks more effectively. The system enables users to register and log in securely, create or join rooms, input their availability, automatically find the best meeting times, and upload or view meeting notes.

The goal of the project is to address common challenges in teamwork - such as difficulty in aligning schedules and maintaining clear communication by offering an all in one collaborative space.
