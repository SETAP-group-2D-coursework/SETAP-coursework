documentation for details.

**Scope of the Project**

**Project Purpose**: Slot-ify is a web - based group scheduling and collaboration application developed to help students coordinate team meetings and manage shared tasks more effectively. The system enables users to register and log in securely, create or join rooms, input their availability, automatically find the best meeting times, and upload or view meeting notes.

**Goals**: The goal of the project is to address common challenges in teamwork - such as difficulty in aligning schedules and maintaining clear communication by offering an all in one collaborative space. 

**User Requirements**

   

   **Authentication**
      - A user can only access room-related features if they are logged in.
      - Session-based authentication (req.session.user_id) ensures only authenticated users can create or join rooms.

   **Create Room**
      - A logged-in user can create a new room by providing a room name.
      - Upon creation, a unique 6-character invite code is automatically generated and stored along with the room.

   **Join Room via Invite Code**
      - A user can join an existing room by submitting a valid invite code.
      - The system checks that the room exists and that the user is not already a participant.
      - Once joined, the user is added to the roomâ€™s participant list, and a notification is created.

   **Access Room Information**
      - A user can retrieve room details either by room ID or by room name.
   
   **Update or Delete Room**
      - Users can update or delete a room they created using the room ID.
      - Room name updates are validated to ensure data consistency.
   
   **Receive Notifications**
      - When a user joins a room, a notification is automatically generated to confirm the action.

## Elements of Implementation
